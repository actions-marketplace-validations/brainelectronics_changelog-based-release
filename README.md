## Requirements

As this Action uses the [changelog2version](https://github.com/brainelectronics/changelog2version)
to parse and extract informations from a changelog, the requirements for the
changelog format have to meet certain criterias.

### Tag section

The header of an entry in the changelog has to follow the following format if
not specified differently with the `version-line-regex` and/or `semver-line-regex`
option in the workflow.

This changelog entry shall follow the
[semantic version pattern](https://semver.org/) and shall match the following
pattern:

`## [x.y.z] - yyyy-mm-dd` or `## [x.y.z] - yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss`

The line shall start with two hashtags (`##`) followed by a single space (` `).
The semver version with `x`, `y` and `z` as non-negative integers, seperated
by a dot (`.`) and surrounded by square brackets (`[]`). Followed by a space
(` `), a dash (`-`), another space (` `) and the
[ISO8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) formatted
date. Additional timestamps after the date, seperated from the date by a
single space (` `) or a capital (`T`), are optional. The semantic version tag
inside the square brackets (`[]`) supports the full semantic versioning scope.

Examples:

- `## [1.2.3] - 2022-11-13`
- `## [1.2.3-alpha-a.b-c-somethinglong+build.1-aef.1-its-okay] - 2022-11-13T12:34:56`

The [changelog](changelog.md) of this repo is an example of how the changelog
shall look like to be parsable with the default changelog2version settings.

## Usage

### Basic usage

With the default values used a GitHub release and tag based on the changelog
located in the project root will be created. For further details check the
[customizing section](#customizing)

See [action.yml](action.yml)

```yaml

    name: Release
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: 'Create changelog based release'
